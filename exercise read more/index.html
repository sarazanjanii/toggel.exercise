                        Front-end development is all about what users see and interact with on a website. It involves
                        designing layouts, implementing styles, and making sure the user interface is both beautiful and
                        functional. Technologies such as HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for
                        interactivity are essential building blocks of front-end work.
                        Modern front-end developers often use powerful libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, or
                        Vue to build dynamic user interfaces. These tools make it easier to manage complex components
                        and state in large applications. They also use responsive design techniques to ensure that
                        websites work on all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
                        Back-end development, by contrast, handles everything that happens behind the scenes. It's
                        responsible for how a website functions, connects to databases, handles authentication, and
                        performs server-side calculations. Technologies like Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), PHP, and
                        Ruby on Rails are commonly used in back-end development.
                        A good example of back-end logic is user login. When a user enters their credentials on the
                        front-end, the data is sent to the server where the back-end checks the database, validates the
                        information, and responds accordingly. This entire process is invisible to the user but is
                        critical for the application's security and functionality.
                        Full-stack developers are professionals who are comfortable working on both front-end and
                        back-end. They understand how each side works and how to integrate them smoothly. In today's
                        fast-paced tech world, full-stack skills are highly valuable because they allow developers to
                        build complete applications independently.
                        Whether you're interested in designing sleek interfaces or building powerful servers and
                        databases, knowing the difference between front-end and back-end will help you choose your path.
                        Both sides are essential to delivering a great user experience and building robust web
                        applications.
